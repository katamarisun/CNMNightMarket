                          IF most recent: NameOfModel_v#_latest.ma
                          
                          NameOfModel_v#_####

                          Example: JadeNecklace_v1_0001.ma
                          
                          v denotes which versions and large changes (e.g. Multiple Grandmas)
                          
                          The final four numbers denote the iteration number
                          
                  Scenes are the same:
                  
                          SceneName_v#_####
# Name ALL Maya objects in your files, or you shall be banished to the land of 90 Degree turns.
